It is very important to have a standardized way to codify and always
focus on codify the same way remember that probably we will have to
give maintainance or add functionalities to our projects, in any case,
to codify under a standard will allow us to create highest quality
projects.

In Python exists PEP's, proposed improvements in Python which at the
moment to codify we will be interested in PEP8.

PEP8 is a codification guide which allow us to write Python code
in a better way, more legible and consistent, by particular 'rules'
and recommendations. For instance, on the guide we can find:

- use spaces instead of tabs
- use snake_case nomenclature to name variables
- use upper case letter for constants

We write rules enclosed in quotes because we can create a script
without following PEP8 recommendations, we just have to be
consistent everytime we codify

If we believe that our codifying way is the wrong or we want to follow
the PEP8 rules then we can verify our code in this web site, we just
have to copy the code we want to verify

If you want to create your own library, we recommend to verify your code.
